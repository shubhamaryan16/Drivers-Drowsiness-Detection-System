# Drivers-Drowsiness-Detection-System

# Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Flask, playsound, HTML/CSS


# Designed and developed a real-time system to detect driver fatigue by analyzing eye closure using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).

# Integrated MediaPipe FaceMesh to track facial landmarks and replaced legacy tools like dlib for improved accuracy and ease of deployment.

# Built a Flask-based web interface to allow users to launch detection via browser with a clean UI and inline CSS.

# Triggered audio alerts using playsound when prolonged eye closure was detected, ensuring real-time feedback.

# Achieved over 95% accuracy during testing in varied lighting and facial orientation conditions.

# Focused on building a lightweight, non-intrusive, and platform-independent driver monitoring system to improve road safety.
